Micro-services using actors model framework for JavaScript.

Studio is a lightweight framework for node (it also runs on major browsers, but the priority is node projects) developed to make easy to create reactive applications according to [reactive manifesto](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) principles. It uses an actor model (freely inspired by akka actors) implemented using [baconjs](https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js) for reactive programming and a+ promises to solve the callback hell problem.

The main goal is to make all systems response, fault tolerant, scalable and mantainable. The development with Studio is (and always will be) as easy as possible, i'll keep a concise api, so other developers can create (and share) plugins for the framework.

Studio isn't only a library, it's a framework. It's really important to learn how to program and not only what each method can do.

I would love to receive feedback.Let me know if you've used it. What worked and what is wrong. Contribute and spread the word.
